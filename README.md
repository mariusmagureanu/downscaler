K8s cluster downscaler
----------------------

This project is a poor man's attempt to reduce cost with running clusters. The idea behind it is to automatically scale up/down the number of worker nodes.
It is assumed that the clusters are used within certain time frames, thus not being needed outside them, e.g. evenings,weekends...etc

## What is it?
